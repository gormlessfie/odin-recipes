            Omelette Rice with Ketchup 'Omurice' is a popular dish in Japan. 
            It consists of a french omelette over fried rice made with ketchup. 
            The sweetness and tartness of the ketchup provides a refreshing balance of 
            creaminess and acidity.

            The fried rice is simple and flexible which allows for many different 
            combination of add-ins such as green beans, ham pieces, or even XO sauce.
