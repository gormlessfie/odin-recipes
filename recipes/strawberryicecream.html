                Strawberry Ice Cream is one of the most common flavors of ice cream available. However, most people do not realize that
                strawberry ice cream is more difficult to create due to problems when balancing water content in the mixure. Most recipes do 
                not account for the extra water content in strawberries which causes more ice crystal causing the mixture to be less smooth.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to counteract the extra water in the mixture, most ice cream recipes uses strawberry extract or powdered strawberries. 
                I found that using a combination of dried strawberries and a strawberry syrup was best for keeping water to a minimum.
